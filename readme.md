### Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed on your machine
- [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) account 

### Setup and authorization via Terminal
- clone this repo  
- create a new App attached to your Telegram account [here](https://my.telegram.org/auth?to=apps) ('URL' & 'Description' fields may be kept empty, 'Platform' - select 'Web') 
- Run `docker volume create your_volume_name` - to create Docker volume on your host
- Run `docker build -t your_image_name .` - to build image from `Dockerfile`
- Run `docker run -it --rm -v your_volume_name:/app/config_resources your_image_name` - to login to your Telegram account 
- Paste your Telegram App's `api_id` and `api_hash` 
Get them from 'App configuration' at https://my.telegram.org/apps 
- [Pyrogram](https://docs.pyrogram.org/) asks to enter the phone number attached to your Telegram account (just digits including Country Code, other symbols can be omitted)
- Paste confirmation code sent by Telegram to your account 
- If your Telegram account has two-step verification enabled - your password will be required 
- When you see `bot started` phrase in Terminal - eight new chats appear in your Telegram account:
  - ‘1.Mentions’ 
  - '2.Pinned_messages' 
  - '3.Find_Telegram_ID'  
  - ‘4.Keywords’
  - ‘5.Following’
  - '6.Edited_and_Deleted_messages_monitoring'
  - '7.Dump_all_from_selected_chat' 
  - '8.Dump_replies'
- Stop the running script: `Ctrl+C`
- Run `docker run -d -v your_volume_name:/app/config_resources --name your_container_name --restart unless-stopped your_image_name` - launch bot 24/7 in a container 

- (optional) (in Telegram) Create a new Folder & add to it manually these eight new chats 
Then - archive manually each of these eight chats from 'All chats' to 'Archived Chats' 
So these eight chats are kept in a separate Folder & do NOT disturb you 

- (optional) To launch Bot with the same Telegram account & data on another machine (aka backup, restore & migrate Docker volume): 
  - (?!) (to back up volume) Run `docker run --rm --volumes-from your_container_name -v $(pwd):/backup_dir ubuntu tar cvf /backup_dir/archive.tar /your_volume_name` - 
  launch new container, mount volume from previous container, mount local host directory, tar contents of volume to 'archive.tar' file
  - (?!) Transfer “archive.tar” file to another machine via SSH with `scp` (or `rsync`):  
  - `scp your_source_user@backup_dir/archive.tar your_destination_user@your_destination_host_ip_address:/your_destination_path` 
  - (?!) (to restore volume from backup) Run `docker run --rm --volumes-from your_new_container -v $(pwd):/backup_dir ubuntu bash -c "cd /your_new_volume && tar xvf /backup_dir/archive.tar --strip 1"` - 
  un-tar 'archive.tar' file in the new container’s data volume
